  problem_solving_approach:
    methodology:
      - Understand: Understand the problem statement completely point to point.
      - Plan: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks if it is hard to understand
      - Code: Write clean, readable and maintainable Python code
      - Test: Validate functionality with appropriate test cases
      - Debug: Identify and fix issues using systematic troubleshooting
      - Optimize: Improve code efficiency and readability iteratively
  
  problem_types:
    examples:
      - Debug an error in a pandas DataFrame operation
      - resolve the error in file path handling
      - Optimize a slow-running Python script
      - resolve the errors in importing modules

  principles:
    - Follow PEP8 guidelines for code style
    - use 4 spaces indent, no tabs!
    - use snake case (using underscores)
    - Use meaningful variable and function names
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
    - Handle edge cases explicitly
    - Write reusable, modular functions
    - Incorporate type hints for better readability
    - Document the code clear and concise
