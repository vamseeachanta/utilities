## Jitesh's tips for AI use

AI tools can be transformative, but they?re only as effective as the effort and finesse you put in.

For the past few months, our team has relied on Cursor, along with the occasional use of ChatGPT or Claude, to enhance productivity.

Here are some best practices we?ve learned for using Cursor:

?? Start with Composer to generate boilerplate code quickly

?? Use it when updating multiple files simultaneously ? it?s efficient but requires caution

?? Don?t let Composer run wild once you have a decent amount of code; it has a tendency to delete chunks unexpectedly

?? Always use diff mode to clearly see changes and stay in control of updates

??? Take regular snapshots or git commits of your code to return to a working version if needed

?? Avoid mixing Cursor with chat functionality ? they don?t play well together and can create conflicts

?? Don?t make manual changes mid-Composer; it doesn?t seem to recognize updates and works off its own memory

AI tools feel like magic, but like any craft, they take practice to master. ? It?s more than just creating boilerplate ? the real work is in the fine-tuning
