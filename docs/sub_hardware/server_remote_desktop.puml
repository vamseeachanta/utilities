note Bottom

    Notes:
        For 2 users, It is important to close all licensed software 
        and log-out in the following example scenarios: 
        1/ When user licensed software runs are done (even after a day or Monday)
        2/ When user licensed software is going to be unused for more than 1 hour duration
        3/ Should not keep open to just block/hoard license unless there is an urgency.

        PS: Best solution is to have a shared common user/password to login and logout.
=======
        **Best solution** : Shared username (eg: orcaflex, ansys etc.)/password pair to login and logout.
           **Full Transperency and Trust** and **No confidentiality** 
        Example solution providers:
        - tightVPN (free)
        - splashtop (USD 10/mo/user)
        - TeamViewer (USD 25/mo for 3 devices), etc.
